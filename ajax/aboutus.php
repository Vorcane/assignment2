HeatWave Gaming sells games and other gaming related products such as game subscriptions, game releases and DLC.</p>";
		
	echo "<p class='bold'>Mission statement: </p><p>Our mission statement is to get everyone gaming by keeping our prices cheap and affordable whilst still delivering the newest releases. We believe that gaming is a great way of interacting with others while also being a great leisure activity. We often support small development teams who are trying to get their business started with their first game by highlighting their products through our site. We aim to bring the best deals to our customers by keeping our prices so red hot we can hardly hold onto the stock.</p>";

	echo "<p class='bold'>Ethos: </p><p>Always keeping games as cheap as possible for all people to be able to participate. All of our employees must have an enthusiastic outlook on games and must be dedicated.</p>";

	echo "<h3 class='center'>The product information</h3>";
	echo "<p>HeatWave gaming primarily deals with the selling of games, customers buy the games through our website and are given a product key and a way of redeeming/downloading the game. Along with games there is also game subscriptions for example games such as World of Warcraft which require a monthly subscription to play. We sell anything from the newest releases to some old favourites. We also sell games which are not so well known to try and promote small developers who are just getting their name out there in the gaming industry. All products sold on the site are digital and no physical products are sold, since games are now primarily downloaded and a product key is used this is the way our site is run.</p>";
